        <h2>Piltover and Zaun: Twin Cities Divided</h2>
        <img src="images/piltover_and_zaun.jpg" alt="Piltover and Zaun">
        <p>Piltover and Zaun are two interconnected yet vastly different cities, representing a major economic and technological hub in Runeterra.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Piltover:</strong> Known as the "City of Progress," Piltover is a wealthy and advanced metropolis built on innovation and trade. It is home to brilliant scientists, skilled artificers, and powerful council members who govern the city. The invention of Hextech transformed Piltover into a dominant force, allowing ordinary people to wield magical energy through technology.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Zaun:</strong> Situated beneath Piltover, Zaun is a chaotic, industrial undercity filled with pollution, crime, and desperation. Though often looked down upon by Piltover’s elite, Zaun thrives in its own way, with self-made inventors and chemtech enhancements. However, the city suffers from extreme inequality, as its residents struggle against disease, corruption, and the rule of brutal crime lords.</p>

        <h2>The Tragic Fall of Jinx and Vi’s Journey</h2>
        <img src="images/jinx_and_vi.webp" alt="Jinx and Vi">
        <p>The personal story of <strong>Vi</strong> and <strong>Jinx</strong> mirrors the greater conflict between Piltover and Zaun. As children, they were orphaned by the battle between enforcers and Zaunites, leading Vi to become a fighter for justice while Jinx fell under Silco’s influence.</p>
        
        <p>Jinx’s descent into madness and her violent actions against Piltover marked a turning point in the conflict. The final moments of Arcane’s first season showed her launching a catastrophic attack on Piltover’s council, setting the stage for an all-out war.</p>
