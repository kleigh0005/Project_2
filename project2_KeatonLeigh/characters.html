        <img src="images/mel photo.jpg" alt="Mel Medarda from Arcane">
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> Mel Medarda is a powerful and ambitious councilwoman of Piltover. Born into the influential Medarda family, she was exiled from her homeland of Noxus due to her ideals clashing with her mother’s militaristic ambitions. Seeking power through diplomacy rather than war, she worked her way into the Piltover Council, where she played a key role in the development of Hextech.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Mel is highly intelligent, manipulative, and strategic. Unlike many in the council, she understands that power is more than just wealth or status—it’s about influence. She is charismatic and persuasive, often outmaneuvering her rivals with sharp political moves rather than brute force.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Role in Arcane:</strong> Mel forms a complex relationship with Jayce Talis, mentoring and guiding him as he rises to prominence in Piltover’s society. She strongly believes in Hextech’s potential but also recognizes the dangers it poses in the wrong hands. Her past eventually catches up with her when her mother arrives from Noxus, forcing Mel to confront her family's dark history.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Influence:</strong> Mel plays a critical role in shaping Piltover’s future. Her vision of a peaceful, progressive city is challenged by the growing tension between Piltover and Zaun, as well as the internal power struggles within the council.</p>
