        <p>The first season of Arcane ended in dramatic fashion, with Jinx launching a rocket directly at the Piltover council chamber, just as they were about to vote on a peace agreement with Zaun. This devastating attack is likely to ignite a full-scale war between the two cities, leaving many characters in peril. With no confirmation on the fate of the council members, Piltover could fall into chaos, and Zaun may seize the moment to fight for its independence.</p>
